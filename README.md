# Database Project
This is a java program that works with Spring in order to present a simple form where you can make a character with certain stats that when run will allow for all submissions to be seen in a SQL database.
# Instructions
after running the program open up the url of *localhost:8080* and you will be presented with a character creation screen. Input whatever values you want and you will have a character added to the database. In order to access the database, go to *localhost:8080/h2-console* and you will be presented with a login. Username: admin Password: password (super secure i know XD)

Once you are in that console a simple query of **select * from user_character** will allow you to see all current people in the database. Its in the end a normal SQL console so any SQL operations will work fine here.
